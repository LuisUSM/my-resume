    <h1>The Best Movies Ever, According to Luis Rivera</h1>
    
    <h2>My Top 3 Movies of All Time</h2>
    
    <hr />
    
    <h3>WALL-E</h3>
    <img src="../../assets/images/portfolio/movie-ranking-page/walle-pixar.jpg" alt="WALL-E movie poster" height="175px">
    <p>The movie of a lonely robot that have lived on Earth for hundreds of years, before finding love and getting into a journey to save the planet. Without saying any word, the main character is able to trap you since the beginning.</p>
    
    <h3>Bolt</h3>
    <img src="../../assets/images/portfolio/movie-ranking-page/bolt-disney.jpg" alt="Bolt movie poster" height="200px">
    <p>This movie tells the beautiful story of a dog that crosses an entire country to meet again with his loved owner, learning to enjoy the simplest moments of life while meeting very good friends in the travel. It always makes me cry at the end because it reminds me of the love that I have to my doggy pet, Spanyi.</p>
    
    <h3>Monsters, Inc.</h3>
    <img src="../../assets/images/portfolio/movie-ranking-page/monsters-inc-pixar.jpg" alt="Monsters Inc. poster" height="250px">
    <p>I love the sense of humor and the universe that was created behind this movie. Just think in a world where monsters rule and, to produce energy, have to go to the human's side of the multiverse and scare their children to get this valuable resource, at the same time struggling with the energetic crisis, a common problem in our modern days. Incredible, amazing! Like its two protagonists, Mike and Sulley!</p>
